Original email:

From this week, I require you to generate a weekly report to cover:
What have you done in this week (May link to other files for results)? What is the progress in this week? Did you complete you last plan?
What is your plan for next week?
 
The report can be very brief – 2-3 points for the completion, and 2-3 points for next week’s plan. Please create a folder in dropbox named WeeklyReport. For each file, please named as 20210615-WeeklyReport-Name. Doc or PDF file will be fine.
 
Please send through email by the end of Friday each week, and please also save one copy in the dropbox. Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks!

## To-do list last week:
- [x] Summary current result.
- [x] Investigate top ranked ERBB2 drugs.
- [x] Repeat VAEN and apply to our data.
- [ ] Discussion: How to tell which method is the best?

## Whats done and current progress:
1. **Result Management** - Summary and archieve the current result files.
    ```
    Google drive:/Drug Response Project/Output/Stat Validation/PCC_CV28_192drugs_05132021.csv
    ```
3. **Investigating Top Ranked ERBB2 Related Drugs**: Check the significant drugs generated by p value rank comparing between ERBB2+ and ERBB2− BRCA patients in TCGA using 9 methods. For each method result, those drugs ranked higher than Lapatinib were recorded and investigated for published interaction with ERBB2. （结论？）
4. **Deep Learning Method (VAEN)**: 
    * Background: Variational autoencoder (VAE) followed by Elastic Net. Workflow: Data preparation and scaling -> Deep learning -> Repeat to generate 100 VAE models -> EN + cross validation, take highest R2 VAE model -> Evaluation 
    1. Repeat VAEN using VAEN data.
    2. Apply VAEN to our data: 
5. **VAEN Clinical Data**: Understand the data structure of 6 clinical datasets. Came up with the plan of how to use them to evaluate our methods.

## To-do list next week:
- [ ] Evaluate VAEN using statistical mesaurements and compare with our methods.
- [ ] Apply our methods to clinical datasets VAEN provided.
    * Divide pts based on the median of predicted result. Conduct survival analysis between 2 groups. Compare p value (smaller better). （合适吗） 
- [ ] Literature review and discussion: How to tell which method is the best?

  
  
  
  
# Investigating Top Ranked ERBB2 Related Drugs

EN: Osimertinib more significant than Lapatinib. Not in 138 drugs(GR) but related to ERBB2 
```
To date, reported resistance
mechanisms to osimertinib include EGFR C797S, MET or ERBB2 amplification, BRAF mutations,
small cell lung cancer (SCLC) transformation and others.
> Piotrowska, Zofia, et al. "MET amplification (amp) is a mjaor resistance mechanism to osimertinib." J Clin Oncol 35 (2017): 9020.

Osimertinib treatment showed robust efficacy in HER2wt overexpression and EGFR del19/HER2 models, but not in HER2 exon 20 insertion tumors.
...
Overall, our data indicated robust antitumor efficacy of osimertinib against multiple HER2 aberrations in lung cancer, either as a single agent or in combination with JQ1.
