# 2021_06_18_WeeklyReport

~~~~
Dear all,
 
From this week, I require you to generate a weekly report to cover:
What have you done in this week (May link to other files for results)? What is the progress in this week? Did you complete you last plan?
What is your plan for next week?
 
The report can be very brief – 2-3 points for the completion, and 2-3 points for next week’s plan. Please create a folder in dropbox named WeeklyReport. For each file, please named as 20210615-WeeklyReport-Name. Doc or PDF file will be fine.
 
Please send through email by the end of Friday each week, and please also save one copy in the dropbox. Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks!

## To-do list last week:
- [x] Summary current result.
- [x] Investigate top ranked ERBB2 drugs.
- [x] Repeat VAEN.
- [ ] Discussion: How to tell which method is the best?

## Whats done and current progress:
1. **Result Management** Summary and archieve the current result files.
2. **Investigating Top Ranked ERBB2 Related Drugs** Check the significant drugs generated by p value rank comparing between ERBB2+ and ERBB2− BRCA patients in TCGA using 9 methods. For each method result, those drugs ranked higher than Lapatinib were recorded and investigated for published interaction with ERBB2. （结论？）
3. **Deep Learning Method (VAEN)**: 
    * Background: Variational autoencoder (VAE) followed by Elastic Net. Workflow: Data preparation and scaling -> Deep learning -> Repeat to generate 100 VAE models -> EN + cross validation, take highest R2 VAE model -> Evaluation 
    1. Repeat VAEN using VAEN data;
    2. Apply VAEN to our data: 
4. **VAEN Clinical Data**: Understand the data structure of 6 clinical datasets. Came up with the plan of how to use them to evaluate our methods.

## To-do list next week:
- [ ] Evaluate VAEN using statistical mesaurements and compare with our methods.
- [ ] Apply our methods to clinical datasets VAEN provided.
    - [ ] Divide pts based on the median of predicted result. Conduct survival analysis between 2 groups.
    - [ ]
